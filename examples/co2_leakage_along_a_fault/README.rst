CO\ :sub:`2`\  leakage along a fault
====================================

The model geometry used in this example is inspired from the paper:

   Cappa, Frédéric, and Jonny Rutqvist. "Modeling of Coupled Deformation and Permeability Evolution during Fault Reactivation Induced by Deep Underground Injection of CO2." International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control 5, no. 2 (March 2011): 336–346. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2010.08.005>.

The fault modeled in this sample problem has already been reactivated by increasing the permeability from its original value.
